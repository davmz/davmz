# Howdy, I'm David! âœŒ

**`Creadevographer Craftsman (Developer / Photographer / Videographer / Cinematographer)`**

Currently an **Associate Consultant at Optimiz and a 2022 Red River College Business Information Technology graduate**, I have a strong passion for becoming a **full-stack/software developer**, continuously expanding my skill set. Lately, Iâ€™ve been exploring *UI/UX design* as an asset to building well-crafted, user-centered applications.

However, I found myself getting **too comfortable, with my priorities out of balanceâ€”neglecting personal development outside of work**. Now, Iâ€™m actively working on breaking that cycle, reigniting my passion, and becoming more involved in side projects and continuous learning. ***My goal is to refocus, grow, and push forward in both development and digital creativity.***
